# Torrent Health Tracker

**Torrent Health Tracker** is a way to provide a web interface into the statistics on the health of a collection of torrents. This is accomplished by looking at assembling tracker stats and periodically re-pinging the swarm. Simplely provide `torrent-health-tracker` with a list of trackers and magnet links and it'll do its thing!

> Note: currently only supports HTTP trackers.
